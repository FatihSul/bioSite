            <h3>Short bio of Muhamed</h3>
            <p>
                Muhamed is my younger brother. He is a dedicated student currently aiming to enter Medical
                School. He is currently studying each night preparing to take the Medical College Admission
                Test (MCAT) so that he can score high and get into a nice Medical School. His ultimate goal is to
                become a cardiologist one day.
                When he isnt working to pursue his goal of entering the medical field he spends his free time
                either going for a walk, biking or gaming. He enjoys taking the time to enjoy the outdoors and
                exercise his cardio when the weather is nice. Taking advantage of the nearby park that spans
                several miles he can enjoy his time to the fullest while appreciating the outdoors with nature
                surrounding him.
                When it comes to gaming he enjoys the fighting game genre the most. Muhamed has been
                enjoying the fighting game genre the most over the years and lately it has been Guilty Gear with
                at least over 1100 hours on the game alone he has picked up and memorized every nuance the
                game has to offer with the variety of playable characters. At this point he can compete at a
                competitive level online against others and put his skill to the test against notable members of
                the online community.
                I do believe this competitive drive in him when it comes to gaming also translates to his pursuits
                in the medical field and it will also help him reach those higher scores on the upcoming MCAT
                scheduled
