                <p>From a young age Muhamed has been focused on one goal. That goal is to become a doctor, a Cardiologist to be specific. Growing up he has seen our dad struggle with his lungs previously being a smoker who quit cold turkey to be better when he had us. That strain that was put on his lungs for however many years it has been was not pleasent so Muhamed is going to try his best to reach his goal and eventually be able to help our father further.</p>

                <p>To this day Muhamed is studying every day to keep up with the large amount of material needed to review in every class he has taken. Right now even during his down time off of school after graduating with a bachelors in science he is still going out of his way to review over and over. Even with a close friend of his they go to the local libraries and focus hard to pass their next obstacle the MCAT.</p>

                <p>The end goal of course is to get into a great medical school. Ideally he wants to get into one that is local so that he does not have to travel as far or worse even dorm maybe a state away for the next four years. That time away from family is not ideal for anyone.</p>
