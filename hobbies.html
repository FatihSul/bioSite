                <p>During his time off he loves to spend it by playing games, his favorite genre are fighting games. Currently hes been loving Guilty Gear Strive. Out of the past few fighting games that have released since Guilty Gear nothing has held a candle to it. Its racked up more hours than most of them combined.He has faced many notable players and been able to compete against them in a fairly fight hopefully one day we can take him to an official tournament and he can place high as well.</p>

                <p>When the weather is nice he also enjoys biking. Its his ideal passtime when he decides to go out to workout and clear his mind. There is a park nearby that spans several miles through a few towns and he likes to do a full lap and time himself to see how he progresses as well always sharing in his top speeds to his friends.</p>

                <p>When it comes to walking we do enjoy going out with the family to enjoy the nice weather and play Pokemon Go together. Especially when it comes to its community day events he likes to put in extra laps with our dad not only for the game but to build cardio for the two of them.</p>
